# KMeanClustering

This program is written in MATLAB and creates k clusters according to euclidean and spearman distance on genetic and hereditary disease dataset with visualization. Their are different classes for this program briefly explained below:

1. genes.m    : To preprocess genetic dataset.
2. diseases.m : To preprocess disease dataset.
3. Knn.m      : Main function which performs k mean cluster. It acts as wrapper and interact with other functions.
4. Centroid.m : Create centroid  and cluster the data.
5. Distance.m : Calculate square of the distance of each element from centroid of their respective clusters.

The datasets are given by RHUL Bioinformatics department for academic purpose only.
